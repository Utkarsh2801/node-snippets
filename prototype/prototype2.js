// Prototypes in JavaScript are the mechanism to share common functionalities between objects.
// When a function is created in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine adds a prototype property to the function.
// This prototype property is an object called as prototype object which has a constructor property by default.
//  The constructor property points back to the function on which prototype object is a property.

// __proto__ is the actual property that is looked up during the prototype chaining.
// It is kind of like a pointer to the prototype object which holds all the methods and properties.
