/** JSON **/

// JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for sharing data.
// Although it's derived from JavaScript - it may be used with many programming languages.

// Where will we use JSON?
// - Data storage
// - Data configuration and verification
// - Generating data structures from user input
// - Data transfer from client to server, server to client, and between servers.

// JSON.stringify function converts a JSON object into string.
// Strings are lightweight and therefore very useful when transporting data from a client to a server.

// JSON.parse convert a string back into a JSON.
