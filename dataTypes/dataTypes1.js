// Six data types that are primitives: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015), Object.
// All types except objects define immutable values (values, which are incapable of being changed).

// JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values.
// Unlike in languages like C, JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created,
// it is not possible to modify it.
